This is an app powered by tkinter and PyTorch, that give you opportunity to draw digits from 0 to 9 in order to see neural network prediction

For the first you should draw your digit using your mouse(left button) and then for the result prediction you should click left button of your mouse once.
To clear window you should click right button of your mouse!
Enjoy!

If it is interesting for you how the neural network has been learned, you can see the file: "MNIST_conv.ipynb". There I have used LeNet5 arkhitekture to classify MNIST dataset and the I have saved the model with trained parameters in order to use it in the project.

It may be difficult to inderstand what is happening here. I mean about commits.
But it is only for my education
